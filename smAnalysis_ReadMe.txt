This version is forked from PacificBiosciences supported master version.

Contains additional files that support base modification analysis to be performed per individual single 
molecules rather than the multi-molecule approach in the standard kineticsTools.

Relevant files are analagous to those in the standard kineticsTools but have prefix 'sm' in front of the file
name, eg smIpdSummary.py vs ipdSummary.py.
